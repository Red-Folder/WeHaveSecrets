# SecretsRUs
A sample site used as part of a web security workshop.  This is current WIP

## Intention
The intention of this site is to be used as an example of poor security practices.

*As such any security flaw is (hopefully) by design.*

This site will be provided to a developer (or group) - and they will be asked to fix those security flaws.

To provide feedback there will a companion project which will, on commit, run the site through a series of pre-developed security attacks.

The developer should work through the security flaws until such point as the companion project fails to exploit the site.

## Interested?
Feel free to contact me if you are interested in the final solution.

I plan to run as a workshop with clients - however, I 'm likely to allow anyone to have a go if they want (I'll need to document).  More on this once I've got the core project in place
